- ~~Implement static IR walk/transform methods~~
- ~~Switch to a map of address -> array of StaticIRStatement per instruction~~
- ~~Implement basic block splitting and coalescing~~
- ~~Implement SRs~~
- ~~Implement function basic block graphs~~
- ~~Implement graph flow reconstruction~~
- ~~Implement basic constant folding~~
- ~~Implement constant rodata reads~~
  - ~~Discovering rodata pointer dereferences~~
- Deprecate `IBuilder.Call*` (this isn't NX-specific, just general cleanup for our structures, because we shouldn't rely on this mechanism)
- ~~Rewrite mature functions~~
  - ~~For when/unless/unconditional~~
  - ~~For while/inversewhile~~
- ~~Implement stores~~
- Define new bundled binary format
  - Remove the embedded binary
- ~~Implement dot graph output~~
- ~~Fix constant folding for rewritten functions~~ (Decided against this)
- ~~Implement load/store state <-> variables~~
- ~~Implement basic SSA~~
- ~~Use SSA data to handle load/store of state~~

- Add second constant folding stage using SSA data
- Add function signature determination
  - Add wrapper functions for jumptable invocations
  - Use function signature for static runFrom instances
- Divide WholeBlockGraph into minimal subgraphs (both for optimization of the graph logic, and for easier reasoning)
- ~~Implement NSO loading~~
- Implement RTLD replacement
- Swap C++ backend for LLVM IR
